Hello. I need research about the most popular "dispensaries" - stores that sell cannabis and related products - in New York City. I need this research to be uploaded to my site, good-weed.co, which is a site about such dispensaries (cannabis stores).

I need a list of the top 10 dispensaries in New York City, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles (40 dispensaries total). 

For each dispensary, I need the following fields:
- name, phone number, 
- physical location(s), website. 
- 


Next steps:
* Content in 5 cities 
* PR

Presentation
- Good-Weed - the First Intl Cannabis Marketplace
1. Cannabis legalization -> overnight market explosion

2. Existing players:	
	- distributors 
	- dispensers 	
	- SaaS 
		- dutchie  
		- weedmaps   
		- leaflink
		- leafy
		- iheartjane 
		
		- all US-only, 
			- no dominant winner, volatile market due to changing regulations 
				- emerging pattern: 'seed to sale' vertical integrators, led by largest players, manufacturers
					- 
		
		- manufacturers  
			- canopy growth corporation
			- tilray + aphria 
			- 
		

3. No Intl Marketplace
Market Efficiency -> Value 
	- connect buyers and sellers 


- get in touch with leading cultivators / manufacturers / dispensers in each country
	- list them?
	- 


reddit: 
- get all the dispensaries 
- 

TODOs:
- in search, if no results, show list of brands (user cards - make new erb for this, showing mostly image and below it the name) - the list of brands is users with "verified". 
- make sure user can be verified via admin dashboard (probably in main admin edit for users)
- so: show list of brands
- in search, make "search state" on top 
- make products/brands show all options, and be vertical accordions
